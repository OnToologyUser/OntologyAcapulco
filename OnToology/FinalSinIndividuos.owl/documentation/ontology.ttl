En filosofia, la mereologia es el estudio de las relaciones entre partes, tanto de las partes con el todo, como de las partes con otras partes.

Tengo dudas en la relacion que existe entre las relaciones \"Mereological\"  con \"inside\" y \"contains\". Parecen ser equivalentes \"isPartOf\" con \"inside\"  y  \"isWholeOf\"  con \"contains\" en http://kauppinen.net/tomi/kauppinen-xmlfinland2009.pdf hay ejemplos de relaciones Mereological. 

No estoy seguro, pero la diferencia que noto es que las Mereological no estan implicadas necesariamente por su ubicacion espacial sino por su estructura organizacional. Pero por que las ubican como relaciones espaciales en la literatura.
Ejemplo tabla empresas y tabla trabajadores. Imaginen que los trabajadores estan ubicados espacialmente. Un trabajador es parte de un empresa y la empresa tiene parte (has-part o isWholeOf) de ese trabador, pero el trabajador no hay una relacion de ubicacion espacial entre el trabajador y la empresa(relaciones \"inside\" y \"contains\")"""@en ;
